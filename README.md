- ðŸ‘‹ Jonghyeon Ko is a PhD candidate in Department of Industrial Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST).

- ðŸ‘€ His research field is  Anomaly Detection in business process event logs, based on his expertise in Process-mining, Statistics and Machine Learning. 

- ðŸŒ± The research subject that I investigated during my PhD program is anomaly (or â€˜outlierâ€™) detection in business process event logs. Event logs are prone to errors, which hamper the possibility of
extracting useful process insights from event log analysis and, therefore, should be fixed through anomaly detection as early as possible. Regarding event log anomaly detection, I have managed 3 research lines during my PhD: (i)
anomaly detection in offline settings, (ii) anomaly detection in online settings, and (iii) log repairing, i.e., anomaly reconstruction. All the methods focus on trace-level anomaly detection, i.e., anomalies
concerning the order and/or occurrence of events in process traces.

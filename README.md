- ðŸ‘€ Dr. Jonghyeon Ko has been actively involved in research related to anomaly detection and process mining, particularly developing novel machine learning techniques to improve the reliability and efficiency of complex information systems. His research career has spanned various prestigious institutions, including:

  - âœ¨ Queensland University of Technology (Australia, Nov.2024 ~ present): As a Research Fellow at the Faculty of Science, he is currently contributing to process data quality research in the Process Science Group, leveraging his long-term expertise on anomaly detection and repair.
  - âœ¨ Jeonju University (S. Korea, 2024): During his tenure as a Research Professor, he continued his research in the field of human behaviour data technology, likely focusing on real-time noise filtering.
Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (Italy, 2022~2023): As a recognition of the quality of his research, Jonghyeon was able to secure a PostDoc position in one of the world-leading groups in process mining research. Supervised by Prof. Fabrizio Maria Maggi and Prof. Marco Montali, he delved deeper into process mining, exploring novel probabilistic and optimization algorithms.
  - âœ¨ Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (S. Korea, 2016~2022): During his Ph.D. and postdoctoral research, he focused on information-theoretic methods for detecting anomalies in business process event logs, laying the foundation for his subsequent research.
